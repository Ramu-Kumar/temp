          Question: "What is a title?",
          Answer: [
            "When you purchase a home, a title gives the person the right to ownership of a certain piece of real estate property. A title report is required in a home purchase or refinance transaction.",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is a title search? ",
          Answer: [
            "A title company conducts a title search which involves researching public records and legal documents for events such as deaths, divorces, court judgements, liens, taxes and wills. It examines public records to confirm a property's legal ownership and find out what claims or liens are on the property.",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is a lien?  ",
          Answer: [
            "Liens can be legal claims against a property that gives creditors stake in the property and a way to collect debts owed. A contractor may have never received payment for work they completed on the property by the previous owner. They could put a lien on the property, and if that lien isn’t discovered in a title search, it would be your responsibility once you’re the owner if you don’t have title insurance. ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is a title defect? ",
          Answer: [
            "A defect is an issue with the property title that impacts the transfer of property ownership. A previous owner might have forged a signature or not paid real estate taxes, and defects like that might go undiscovered in the title search process. If you get title insurance, you won’t be responsible for dealing with any claims and legal fees associated with undiscovered defects — your title company will.",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is an easement? ",
          Answer: [
            "Easements are a limited right to use another person's land for a stated purpose. If they aren’t disclosed properly, they won’t show up in a title search. They’ll become your issue to deal with once you are the owner if you don’t have title insurance. ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What if the title search uncovers issues?  ",
          Answer: [
            "Let’s say a lien is uncovered on the property and that the lien was filed by a contractor who performed work and was never paid. The title company will work with the contractor and the  seller on a resolution.",
            "The resolution may involve the seller paying off the debt, or, if the seller doesn’t have the money to pay the debt, the title company may negotiate to wrap the cost of the debt into the seller’s closing costs — ultimately deducting the expense from the home sale proceeds.",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is a clear title? ",
          Answer: [
            "The goal of a title search is for a title company to produce a clear title, which is a title without liens and poses no question to legal ownership and is marketable to future sellers. This is required for any real estate transaction to go through properly.",
            "Once clear title is established a certificate of title is issued which identifies the current vested owner’s and shows how any impactful exceptions to coverage were resolved prior to closing. A certificate of title does not guarantee a free and clear title, though, which is why title insurance is purchased – to protect the lender and buyer from any claims that may arise.  ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "Do I get to pick my own title company? ",
          Answer: [
            "Yes, and you should absolutely shop around to find the best rate. Your real estate agent may recommend a specific title company, but you have the right to choose your title provider and there are some out there — like Radian Title — that can offer you significant savings. ",

        {
          Question: "What happens if my home increases or decreases in value? ",
          Answer: [
            "Title insurance is a one-time payment made at your closing. Your policy won’t change after that point. You won’t owe more money if the value of your property increases. Similarly, if the value of your property decreases, you won’t get money back. ",

        {
          Question:
            "Do I need title insurance if I inherit property or does it transfer from the previous owner? ",
          Answer: [
            "You still need title insurance if you inherit property because a change of ownership is occurring.",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "Should I get title insurance if I buy a condo? ",
          Answer: [
            "Yes. A condo might have the same issues with title that a house would, and you will want to protect yourself.",

          Question:
            "What is the difference between a title commitment and a title policy? ",
          Answer: [
            "A title insurance provider issues a title commitment before closing. The title commitment outlines what the title insurance policy is willing to cover under certain conditions. If those conditions are met, then the title policy is issued after closing when the premium payment is received. The policy is what provides you with protection. ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What is not covered under a title insurance policy? ",
          Answer: [
            "Title insurance doesn’t cover things like damage to your home from a fire or robberies. Those problems can be covered with homeowners insurance. ",

        {
          Question:
            "Is there a difference between buying, selling or refinancing a home? ",
          Answer: [
            "Title insurance policies might vary depending if you are buying, selling or refinancing a home.",

            "A vast majority of banks and mortgage lenders require you to get a lender’s policy if you’re getting a loan for your home purchase or refinancing. ",

            "But buyers — both those who get a loan and those who pay in cash — should also get an owner’s policy to protect their own equity in the property (i.e. their down payment).",

            " Sellers only need to worry about title insurance in certain locations.  ",

      Title: "Closing Process",
      RichTextData: [
        {
          Question: "What is a closing agent? ",
          Answer: [
            "Closing agents can be a representative of a title company, an escrow agent, settlement agent or a real estate attorney that conducts the closing (or settlement) of a home purchase transaction. Their main function is to ensure the proper transfer of the legal title and overseeing the closing process (coordinating the document signing, verifying all parties involved have performed their required responsibilities, making sure everything happens in the right order and on time). ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "Can I choose my closing agent? ",
          Answer: [
            "Real estate agents may recommend or select the closing agent with your permission, but you can choose your own closing agent if you wish, subject to reasonable requirements imposed by your lender, no matter if the transaction is a purchase or refinance.  ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "When can I close? ",
          Answer: [
            "For purchase transactions, a tentative closing date is established within the purchase agreement, but it can change during the pre-closing process. ",

            " The closing can occur following a clear title. Ownership is officially transferred from the seller to the homebuyer at the closing, or for a refinance when the funds are disbursed.  ",

            "To prepare, the closing agent assigns a signing agent to meet with the borrower on the actual closing day to ensure all the loan and title documents are executed and signed by the borrower, witnesses signatures, collects funds, and ensures paperwork is filed correctly, notarized, and processed on time.  ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "Will I receive any documents prior to closing to review? ",
          Answer: [
            "Prior to the closing date the settlement or closing agent will work with the lender to finalize the figures for closing. The closing agent will deliver these figures to the lender who then provides them to all parties involved via a closing disclosure form. This form is provided three business days prior to closing, for final review by all parties.  ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "Who needs to be at the closing? ",
          Answer: [
            "The signing parties will be instructed as to who will need to be present including witnesses as applicable. Sometimes there are parties that are not buyers or sellers who need to be present to sign such as non- borrowing spouses or other parties with potential interest in the property.  ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What does escrow mean? ",
          Answer: [
            "Escrow is a legal arrangement in which a third party controls money or assets until two other parties involved in a transaction meet certain conditions.  ",

            "When you are buying a home, you might deposit a sum of money into an escrow account at the request of your real estate agent to show the home seller that you are serious about buying their home.  ",

            "Once all the necessary paperwork is signed and the closing is complete, the money from the escrow account is released and you can apply it to your down payment or closing costs. ",
          ],
        },
        {
          Question: "What happens after the closing? ",
          Answer: [
            "Following closing, a final ‘post-closing’ review of all documentation is performed by the lender to validate the loan was executed properly. If something was not executed correctly or is missing, the title company will work to correct the issue or reach out to obtain the missing information. It’s very important to provide any missing information to avoid delays. ",

            "After the lender gives final approval, after funding, and disbursement is complete, it’s time to “record” the home purchase or refinance: The title company puts a real estate document into the official records at the County Recorders or Recorder of Deeds Office where the property is located.

        {
          Question: "When do I get my title insurance policy? ",
          Answer: [
            "The last step of obtaining a title is the actual issuance of the final title insurance policy.  ",

            "After a title company confirms that all the appropriate steps were taken to close the loan, such as re-validating ownership through any filed deeds, that the payoffs were made to the appropriate parties, and that all buyer stipulations were met, the title insurance policy is issued and a copy of the lender’s policy is sent to the borrower and the lender. A copy of the owner’s policy is sent to the buyer.  ",

            "Insurance premiums are often set or pre-approved by regulators and every state has different regulations. Some title company’s charge more fees (which are not regulated) on top of the premium than others, which is why you should shop around for title insurance.  ",
