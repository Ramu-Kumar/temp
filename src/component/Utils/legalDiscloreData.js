      text: `Please note that your lender may require additional coverage (endorsements) that may add to the cost of your title insurance. Your lender may also have closing fees that should be disclosed on your Loan Estimate form. Eligibility for refinance discounts, where available, is subject to evidence of a prior mortgage or owner’s policy (in certain states) within the proper time frame and of sufficient amount. RADIAN TITLE INSURANCE INC. does not provide legal advice. If you require personal legal representation or if you have legal questions regarding your closing, we recommend that you contact an attorney. Certain states require that closings be conducted through licensed resident escrow agents or through resident attorneys. Certain other states require that title insurance policies be issued through resident agents or agencies. In such states, RADIAN TITLE INSURANCE INC. will work through a licensed title agent, escrow agent, or attorney.`,

The most recent rate order setting the basic premium amount was effective May 1, 2013. The full table of the Texas Title Insurance Basic Premium Rates can be accessed at http://www.tdi.texas.gov/title/titlerates2013.html. Charges for endorsements can be determined by referring to the Rate Rules in the Basic Manual of Rules, Rates and Forms for the Writing of Title Insurance in the State of Texas, Section III at http://www.tdi.texas.gov/title/titlemm3.html. This calculator is based on the promulgated rates as of May 01, 2013. The cost of your title insurance will depend on several variables; for example, the sales price of your home, the amount financed, and the endorsements that are selected at the time of closing; therefore, this rate calculator should be used as a reference tool only.
